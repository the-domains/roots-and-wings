To become the best man I possibly can be. In work and in private life. That is my quest. For myself and for the ones I hold dear. I draw my inspiration for this deeply personal project from the knowledge and experiences of all kinds of sources and ages. Classical philosophy and poetry, modern social science and corporate culture to name a few. Scientists, entrepreneurs, leaders, artists, singers and writers all contribute to my collection of wisdom. Insights that I gladly share here for the benefit of all who want to embark on a similar journey.
