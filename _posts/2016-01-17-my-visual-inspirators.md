Why do we make the things we make? Where does our inspiration flow from? Are we aware of all those influences? I think not.

But I do believe we should investigate. In order to learn more about ourselves. In order for our art to develop. In order to stand firmly for what we create. And in order to give credit where credit is due.

In this mindmap, which is not complete by definition and a constant work in progress, I look at the themes and sources that have inspired me and that continue to inspire me. Sometimes it surprises me, sometimes it explains a lot. It certainly shows me a way forward.
